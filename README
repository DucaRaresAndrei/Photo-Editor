	Main program:

  The algorithm continues execution as long as commands are entered.
  Through the variable "nr" we find out how many words the entered text has,
a fact that will help us discover if it is a valid command.
  The program observes if it is finished before freeing the memory of a picture
and frees it.

	Functions used:

-alloc_m and free_m: for memory allocation and release.

-free_all: used both at the end of the program and after the exit command. It is
also used in the load function, when we already have a picture loaded.

-load (with p2, p3, p5, p6 and skip_comm): performs the operation of loading a
picture into memory. Helper functions are used to read the file type
corresponding to magic word.

-select_z / select_all: select either a coordinate area of the picture or the
whole picture.

-histogram: make the histogram of the image, using the formula, the maximum
number of * and the number of bins.

-equalize: a grayscale image is required, for which equalization can be done. In
the case of images with an incorrect exposure, certain details in them could be
neglected, for this reason needing the equalize command.

-rotate (with check_selection, r_180, r_90_all/r_90_sel, r_270_all/r_270_sel):
rotates the selected square surface, or the entire picture, with one of the
supported angles (0, +-90, +-180, +-270, +-360).

-crop: cut the image referring only to the old selected area from now on.

-apply (with help_apply, a_red, a_green, a_blue): a color image is requested,
for which to apply the selected filter (EDGE, SHARPEN, BLUR, GAUSSIAN_BLUR).
Each of a_red/a_green/a_blue apply the selected filter to the matrix containing
the specified color.

-save: saves the entire edited image according to the 2 possible types, ascii or
binary. The name of the saved file, which contains the new picture, is given
from the keyboard.
